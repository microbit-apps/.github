## VS Code extension for MakeCode

Until the extension is updated in the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edu.pxt-vscode-web), 
you need to build from sources as follows:

1.  Install VS Code (if you already have the MakeCode extension installed, uninstall it)
2.  Clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-makecode (the source of the extension)
3.  cd to vscode-makecode
4.  yarn install
5.  code .
6.  F5 to run new instance of VS Code
7.  In this new instance, open a folder containing a micro:bit app, such as
     - https://github.com/microbit-apps/microdata
8.  Click on the MakeCode icon on the left of VS Code to see options
