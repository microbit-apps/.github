## Welcome to Micro:bit Apps!

We are all about creating applications that run on the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org) 
that expand its reach in schools and out in the world.  Micro:bit applications 
often take advantage of [display shield technology](https://github.com/microbit-apps/display-shield) 
that enables features that usually require a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop. 
So, micro:bit  apps are generally portable and don't need an internet connection. As the
micro:bit only has 128kB of RAM and 512kB flash, it's a challenge to create
applications in this relatively low-resource setting.
