## Welcome to Micro:bit Apps!

We create applications that run on the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org) 
to expand its reach in schools and out in the world.  Micro:bit apps 
often take advantage of [display shields](https://github.com/microbit-apps/display-shield) 
with a small color screen and controls, enabling features that usually require a smartphone, 
tablet, laptop or desktop. Micro:bit apps are generally portable and don't require an extra 
computer or internet connection. As the micro:bit only has 128kB of RAM and 512kB flash, 
it's a challenge to create apps for this relatively low-resource setting.

> Please note, we are NOT developing [mobile apps for the micro:bit](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/),
> which are apps that generally run on iPad, iPhone or Android device and communicate over Bluetooth to a micro:bit.

## Developer Resources

We develop micro:bit apps using Microsoft MakeCode tooling.  A number of MakeCode extensions (libraries)
provide 

### MakeCode tooling

- VS Code extension for MakeCode
- Web app
- [MakeCode CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-mkc) is used to compile a MakeCode project to a hex file (binary) for copying to a micro:bit.

### MakeCode extensions
  - [display shield](https://github.com/microbit-apps/display-shield)
  - [user interface]

### MakeCode for the micro:bit

  - [microsoft/pxt-microbit](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-microbit)
  - [microsoft/pxt-common-packages](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-common-packages)
  - [microsoft/pxt](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt)

### CODAL C++ runtime
  - [codal-microbit-v2]
  - [codal-nrf52]
  - [codal-core]
