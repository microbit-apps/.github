## Welcome to Micro:bit Apps!

We are all about creating applications that run on the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org) 
that expand its reach in schools and out in the world.  Micro:bit apps 
often take advantage of [display shield technology](https://github.com/microbit-apps/display-shield) 
that enables features that usually require a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop. 
Micro:bit apps are generally portable and don't require an extra computer or 
internet connection. As the micro:bit only has 128kB of RAM and 512kB flash, it's a 
challenge to create apps for this relatively low-resource setting.

> Please note, we are NOT developing [mobile apps for the micro:bit](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/),
> which are apps that generally run on iPad, iPhone or Android device and communicate over Bluetooth to a micro:bit.
